<ul>
  <li>The Mnist dataset is a dataset of handwritten numbers that is frequently used in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</li>
  <li>This dataset is frequently used in both academic research and industrial applications.</li>
  <li>In this project, I aimed to classify figures using deep learning methods using Mnist dataset.</li><br>

  <li>The Mnist dataset consists of 60,000 training data and 10,000 test data.</li>
  <li>Each data point is a 28x28 pixel image and is represented by grayscale levels from 0 to 255.</li>
  <li>Deep learning methods have been very successful in recognizing the figures in this dataset.</li>
  <li>Among these methods, convolutional neural networks (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN) are one of the most effective.</li>
  <li>CNNs consist of several convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling layers.</li>
  <li>These layers process the data, which is transmitted to an output layer, which determines what digit is possible in the final layer.</li>
  <li>In the training process, the model learns using most of the training data, and in the testing process it is used to classify the numbers in the test data.</li>
  <li>In this process, several factors such as weight adjustments and hyperparameters can be optimized to increase the accuracy of the model.</li>
  <li>These affect the performance of the model.</li>
